## Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

Go to: **Vercel ‚Üí Followlytics ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

Add these **NEW** environment variables:

```bash
# Standard Plan (monthly $19)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_STANDARD=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# (Copy from Stripe Standard product price ID)

# Pro Plan (monthly $39)  
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# (Copy from Stripe Pro product price ID)

# Agency Plan (monthly $99)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_AGENCY=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# (Copy from Stripe Agency product price ID)

# Founder Lifetime (one-time $119)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_FOUNDER=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# (Copy from Stripe Founder Lifetime product price ID)
```

**For each variable:**
1. Click "Add New"
2. Name: (copy from above)
3. Value: (paste price ID from Stripe)
4. Environments: ‚úÖ Production, ‚úÖ Preview, ‚úÖ Development
5. Click "Save"

---

## Step 3: Update Webhook to Handle Lifetime Payments

The webhook at `/api/stripe/webhook` needs to handle both:
- `checkout.session.completed` for subscriptions (monthly plans)
- `checkout.session.completed` for one-time payments (founder lifetime)

**Key difference:**
- **Subscriptions:** Have `subscription` object
- **One-time payments:** No `subscription` object, check `mode === 'payment'`

The webhook should:
1. Check if `event.data.object.mode === 'payment'` ‚Üí Lifetime purchase
2. If lifetime, grant `founder` tier permanently (no expiration)
3. Store `lifetimeAccess: true` in Firestore user doc

---

## Step 4: Cap Founder Lifetime to 150 Buyers

### Option A: Manual Tracking (Recommended for MVP)
1. Create Firestore collection: `founder_purchases`
2. On successful purchase, add document with `userId`, `timestamp`
3. Count documents before allowing purchase
4. If count >= 150, disable "Claim Your Spot" button

### Option B: Stripe Inventory (Advanced)
1. Use Stripe's inventory management
2. Set max quantity to 150
3. Stripe auto-disables when sold out

---

## Step 5: Redeploy After Adding Environment Variables

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Vercel does NOT auto-redeploy when you add environment variables!

After adding all price IDs:
1. Go to: **Vercel ‚Üí Deployments**
2. Click: **Redeploy** on latest deployment
3. Wait ~2 minutes for deployment to complete

---

## Step 6: Test Each Plan

### Test Standard ($19/mo)
1. Go to: https://followlytics-zeta.vercel.app/pricing
2. Click "Start Free Trial" under **Standard**
3. Should redirect to Stripe checkout
4. Price shown: **$19.00/month**
5. Complete test purchase (use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`)

### Test Pro ($39/mo)
- Same process, verify price: **$39.00/month**

### Test Agency ($99/mo)
- Same process, verify price: **$99.00/month**

### Test Founder Lifetime ($119)
1. Click "Claim Your Spot" under **Founder Lifetime**
2. Should redirect to Stripe checkout
3. Price shown: **$119.00** (NO "/month")
4. Mode should be: **Payment** (one-time)
5. Complete test purchase

---

## Stripe Test Cards

Use these for testing:
```
Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
3D Secure: 4000 0025 0000 3155

Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "This plan is not yet configured"

### Stripe checkout shows wrong price

- ‚úÖ Redeploy

### Founder Lifetime shows "/month"
- ‚ùå Created as recurring in Stripe
- ‚úÖ Recreate product with "One time" billing
- ‚úÖ Update price ID in Vercel

### Webhook not updating tier
- ‚ùå Webhook not deployed
- ‚úÖ Check webhook endpoint exists: `/api/stripe/webhook`

## Migration from Old Pricing

### Existing Customers
- Keep their current pricing (grandfather clause)
- Don't force upgrades
- Optionally: Offer to switch to new pricing if it's cheaper

### Communication
```

We've reduced our prices:
- Standard: $29 ‚Üí $19 (-34%)
- Pro: $79 ‚Üí $39 (-51%)

```

## Founder Lifetime Strategy

### Scarcity Marketing
- "Only 150 spots available"
- "X spots remaining" (update in real-time)
- "Lock in lifetime access for $119"

### Benefits
- No monthly fees ever
- All future updates included
- Founder badge in dashboard
- Early access to new features
- Exclusive founder community

### After Selling Out
- Remove tier from pricing page
- Show "SOLD OUT - 150/150 claimed"
- Create urgency for monthly plans

---

## Revenue Projections

### Before (Old Pricing)
- Starter: $29/mo
- Pro: $79/mo
- Enterprise: $199/mo

**100 customers = $10,700/mo MRR**

### After (New Pricing)
- Standard: $19/mo √ó 50 users = $950/mo
- Pro: $39/mo √ó 30 users = $1,170/mo
- Agency: $99/mo √ó 10 users = $990/mo
- Founder Lifetime: $119 √ó 150 = **$17,850 one-time**

**Monthly: $3,110/mo MRR**
**One-time: $17,850** (from founders)
**Year 1 Total: $37,320 + $17,850 = $55,170**

### Conversion Strategy
- Lower prices = higher conversion rate
- Lifetime offer = cash injection upfront
- Use founder cash to fund growth marketing
- Upsell monthly users over time
