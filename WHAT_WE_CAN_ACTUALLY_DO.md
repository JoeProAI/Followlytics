## 🚀 WHAT WE CAN BUILD WITH DAYTONA

### 1. **Historical Tweet Tracker** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

```

**Value:** "Your engagement dropped 40% in the last 2 weeks" vs just seeing current numbers

**What We Need:**
- Daytona sandbox with PostgreSQL
- Cron job to fetch tweets daily
- Store: tweet_id, text, metrics, timestamp
- API endpoint to query historical data
