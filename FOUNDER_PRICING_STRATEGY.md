## 🎯 **PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING**

### **Why $299 Works:**

1. **Under $300 Threshold**
   - Feels like "under $300"
   - Easier impulse buy than $349+
   - Credit card friendly

2. **Significant Discount vs Monthly**
   - Agency: $249/mo → $299 lifetime = **88% off year 1**
   - Pro: $79/mo → $299 lifetime = **68% off year 1**
   - Clear value proposition

3. **Scarcity Creates Urgency**
   - "100 spots only" (not 150 or unlimited)
   - "Limited offer" = FOMO
   - Can't wait, might miss out

4. **Premium Positioning**
   - Not "cheap" ($49-$99 feels risky)
   - Not "expensive" ($499+ requires more thought)
   - **Sweet spot** for SaaS lifetime deals
