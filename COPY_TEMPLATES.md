## X/TWITTER LAUNCH CONTENT

### Launch Thread (10-12 tweets)

```
1/ We analyzed 1,000 X creator profiles to find what separates the top 10% from everyone else.

The data revealed 3 counterintuitive patterns.

Here's what most creators get wrong (and what top performers do differently):

ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡

2/ FINDING #1: Post frequency matters less than you think.

â€¢ Top 10% creators: 8-12 posts/week
â€¢ Average creators: 15-20 posts/week

Quality beats quantity. But there's a catch... [Continue]

3/ The catch: Top creators reply to 40%+ of their mentions.

Average creators reply to <10%.

Engagement isn't just posting. It's participating.

[Chart: Reply rate vs follower growth]

4/ FINDING #2: Posting time windows matter MORE than specific times.

Top creators post in 2-hour windows when their audience is active.

They don't obsess over "8:47 AM is optimal."

They test, measure, and repeat what works for THEIR audience.

5/ How do you find your windows?

We tested this on 200 accounts. Found that:

â€¢ Morning window (7-9 AM): Best for B2B/professional
â€¢ Lunch window (12-2 PM): Best for news/entertainment
â€¢ Evening window (7-9 PM): Best for personal brands

But test YOUR audience.

6/ FINDING #3: Content mix drives growth more than virality.

Top creators have a pattern:
â€¢ 40% education/value
â€¢ 30% commentary/opinions
â€¢ 20% engagement (questions, polls)
â€¢ 10% personal/behind-the-scenes

Viral tweets are lottery tickets. Consistency wins.

7/ We found this by analyzing:
â€¢ 1,000 creator accounts
â€¢ 2M+ tweets
â€¢ 18 months of data

Patterns emerged that surprised us.

8/ The most shocking stat?

76% of creators who track competitors grow faster than those who don't.

Why? They see what works BEFORE testing it themselves.

They adapt winning patterns instead of guessing.

9/ That's why we built Followlytics.

Turns X analytics into action:
âœ“ Track competitors
âœ“ Analyze your patterns
âœ“ Get AI recommendations
âœ“ See what's working in real-time

[Demo GIF showing dashboard]

10/ Right now: Founder Lifetime access ($119 one-time).

Limited to 150 buyers. After that, monthly only.

## PRODUCT HUNT LAUNCH

### Tagline (< 60 chars)
> Twitter analytics that actually help you grow

### First Comment (Founder introduction)

```
Hey Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joe, and I built Followlytics because Twitter analytics felt useless.

**The problem:**
Twitter gives you data. But data without context is just noise.

You know your tweets got 1,247 impressions. Cool. Now what?

**What we built:**
Followlytics turns analytics into actions:

1. **Competitor tracking** â†’ See what's working for others in your niche
2. **Pattern analysis** â†’ Identify what drives YOUR engagement
3. **AI recommendations** â†’ Get told exactly what to post and when
4. **Trend detection** â†’ Spot rising topics before they peak

**Who it's for:**
Creators, marketers, agencies. Anyone who's serious about growing on X/Twitter.

**Pricing:**
â€¢ Free trial (7 days, no card)
â€¢ Standard $19/mo
â€¢ Pro $39/mo (MOST POPULAR)
â€¢ Agency $99/mo
â€¢ Founder Lifetime $119 one-time (limited to 150)

**Try it:**
[Link to app]

No signup required to see a demo. Just click and explore.

**What I'd love feedback on:**

## SHOW HN POST

### Title
```
Show HN: Followlytics â€“ Turn Twitter followers into growth insights
```

### Post Body
```
Hey HN,

I built Followlytics to solve a problem I had: Twitter analytics told me what happened, but not what to do next.

**What it does:**
Analyzes your Twitter account + competitors to show you:
â€¢ What content patterns drive engagement for YOU
â€¢ When your specific audience is most active
â€¢ What your competitors are doing that works
â€¢ AI-generated recommendations based on your niche

**Tech stack:**
â€¢ Next.js 14 (App Router)
â€¢ Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
â€¢ Twitter API v2 (OAuth 2.0)
â€¢ Vercel (Hosting)
â€¢ Stripe (Payments)

**Demo:**
You can try it without signing up: [Link to demo with sample data]

**Business model:**
Freemium. Free tier for basic analytics. $19-99/mo for advanced features. Currently offering Founder Lifetime ($119 one-time) for first 150 buyers.

**What I learned building this:**
1. Twitter API v2 is... interesting. OAuth flow took longer than expected.
2. Real-time analytics at scale is hard. Caching strategy was key.
3. Competitor tracking is THE killer feature. Users love it most.

**Looking for feedback on:**
1. Feature priorities â€“ what would you add next?
2. Pricing â€“ fair or too high/low?
3. Technical approach â€“ how would you improve it?

Happy to answer questions about the build, business model, or Twitter API specifically.

## REDDIT POSTS

### r/SocialMediaMarketing

**Title:** I analyzed 1,000 Twitter creator accounts. Here's what correlates with growth.

**Body:**
```
Spent the last 3 months analyzing Twitter creator accounts to build Followlytics. Found some counterintuitive patterns.

**Top 3 findings:**

1. **Reply rate > Post frequency**
Top 10% creators reply to 40%+ of mentions.
Average creators reply to <10%.
Engagement begets engagement.

2. **Content mix > Virality**
Top creators follow a pattern:
â€¢ 40% educational/value
â€¢ 30% commentary
â€¢ 20% engagement (polls, questions)
â€¢ 10% personal
They're consistent, not viral.

3. **Competitor tracking = Growth hack**
76% of creators who track competitors grow faster.
Why? They see what works before testing it.

Built Followlytics to automate this analysis: [Link]

Free trial if you want to try it on your account.

Would love feedback from other marketers here. What metrics do you track on Twitter?
