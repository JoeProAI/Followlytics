# Beta Access System - User Guide

## Overview

The beta access system allows you to give users **100% discount** on subscriptions, making Followlytics completely free for beta testers while keeping the Stripe payment system fully functional.

---

## How It Works

1. **Beta users** have a `betaAccess: true` flag in their Firestore user document
2. When they subscribe, a **100% discount coupon** is automatically applied
3. They get a **$0.00 subscription** in Stripe (free!)
4. All premium features unlock normally
5. Webhooks fire and everything works as if they paid

## Security Notes

- âœ… Only admins (in `ADMIN_EMAILS`) can grant/revoke beta access
- âœ… Beta status is stored in Firestore (server-side, can't be faked)
- âœ… Checkout verifies beta status on the server
- âœ… Users can't grant themselves beta access via client code

---
