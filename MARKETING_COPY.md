## üí¨ FAQ Responses

### "Where does the data come from?"
**Answer:** "We extract data from public Twitter profiles - the same information you can see by visiting any profile page. We just do it faster and at scale."

### "Is this legal?"
**Answer:** "Yes. We only collect publicly available data (usernames, bios, follower counts, etc.). This is the same approach used by billion-dollar companies like ZoomInfo, Hunter.io, and Clearbit."

### "Will my account get banned?"
**Answer:** "No. We don't access your Twitter account or require your credentials. We're extracting public data from other accounts, not using your account to do it."

### "How accurate is the data?"
**Answer:** "Extremely accurate. We pull data directly from Twitter profiles in real-time. If it's on their profile, we capture it."

### "Can I extract private accounts?"
**Answer:** "No. We only extract data from public accounts. Private accounts require authentication and are not accessible through our service."

### "What if I need more credits?"
**Answer:** "Credits roll over month-to-month (up to 2x your monthly allocation). If you need more immediately, overage rates are automatically applied at discounted per-unit pricing."
