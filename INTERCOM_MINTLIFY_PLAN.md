# Intercom + Mintlify Integration Plan
**Updated:** Oct 27, 2025

---

## 💬 INTERCOM CHATBOT

### Why Intercom?
- Real-time support without hiring team
- Onboarding automation
- Upsell triggers
- User engagement tracking
- Knowledge base integration

### When to Add
**Trigger:** After 50 paying customers (Month 2-3)

**Why wait:**
- Free tier covers <500 users
- Manual support is fine for first 50
- Focus on product first
- Add when support becomes bottleneck

---

## 🎯 INTERCOM USE CASES

### 1. Onboarding Flow
```javascript
// Trigger when user signs up
Intercom.trackEvent('user_signed_up')

// Show guided tour
"👋 Welcome to Followlytics! Let's extract your first 100 followers (free)"

// Steps:
1. Enter X username
2. Click "Extract Followers"
3. View analytics
4. Try AI post generator (Pro users)
```

**Goal:** 80% of new users complete first extraction

---

### 2. Upsell Triggers
```javascript
// When user hits free limit
if (extractionsThisMonth >= 100 && tier === 'free') {
  Intercom.showMessage({
    title: "You've extracted 100 followers! 🎉",
    body: "Upgrade to Starter for 5,000/month. Just $19.",
    cta: "Upgrade Now"
  })
}

// When Starter user extracts 4,500
if (extractionsThisMonth >= 4500 && tier === 'starter') {
  Intercom.showMessage({
    title: "Almost at your limit!",
    body: "Pro plan gives you 50,000 followers + AI features.",
    cta: "View Pro Features"
  })
}
```

**Goal:** 25% conversion on upsell messages

---

### 3. Feature Discovery
```javascript
// User hasn't used analytics yet
if (daysSinceSignup > 3 && !usedAnalytics) {
  Intercom.showMessage({
    title: "Did you know?",
    body: "Your Follower Intelligence dashboard tracks growth, unfollows, and insights automatically!",
    cta: "View Analytics"
  })
}

// Pro user hasn't used AI
if (tier === 'pro' && !usedAI) {
  Intercom.showMessage({
    title: "Try your AI Post Generator! 🤖",
    body: "Get 10 viral-optimized post ideas in seconds.",
    cta: "Generate Posts"
  })
}
```

**Goal:** 60% feature adoption rate

---

### 4. Retention & Re-engagement
```javascript
// Inactive users
if (daysSinceLastLogin > 14) {
  Intercom.sendEmail({
    subject: "We miss you! Here's what's new...",
    body: "Your followers grew by 12% since last visit!",
    cta: "See Who Followed You"
  })
}

// Churned users
if (subscription.status === 'canceled') {
  Intercom.showMessage({
    title: "Before you go...",
    body: "What can we do better? Get 50% off if you come back!",
    cta: "Give Feedback"
  })
}
```

**Goal:** Reduce churn from 30% to 15%

.env.local
vercel.json (with secrets)
```
