# 💰 How to Collect Your Revenue (Finally!)

## Overview
Your API was tracking charges but NOT collecting money. Now it's fixed with a **prepaid credit system**.

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
1. Customer uses API
2. You track what they owe: "$1.85 profit"
3. **No actual money collected** ❌

### After (Working):
1. Customer buys $100 in credits ($105 with 5% bonus)
2. Credits added to their account balance
3. Customer uses API → $2 per 1K followers **automatically deducted**
4. **You collect $100 upfront** ✅

## 💵 Credit System Details

### Pricing Packages:
| Purchase Amount | Credits Received | Bonus | Cost Per 1K Followers |
|-----------------|------------------|-------|----------------------|
| $50 | $50 | $0 | $2.00 |
| $100 | $105 | $5 (5%) | $2.00 |
| $250 | $265 | $15 (6%) | $2.00 |
| $500 | $550 | $50 (10%) | $2.00 |

### How Credits Are Used:
- Customer extracts 1,000 followers → **$2.00 deducted** from balance
- Customer extracts 10,000 followers → **$20.00 deducted** from balance
- Customer extracts 100,000 followers → **$200.00 deducted** from balance

### Your Profit:
- Apify cost: $0.15 per 1K followers
- You charge: $2.00 per 1K followers
- **Profit: $1.85 per 1K followers (92.5% margin)**

## 📊 Revenue Flow

### Example: Customer buys $100 credits

**Day 1: Purchase**
```
Customer pays: $100
Stripe fee (2.9% + $0.30): -$3.20
You receive: $96.80
Customer gets: $105 credits (5% bonus)
```

**Day 2-30: API Usage**
```
Customer extracts 50,000 followers total
- 50K / 1,000 = 50 units
- 50 × $2.00 = $100 charged
- 50 × $0.15 = $7.50 Apify cost
- Profit: $100 - $7.50 = $92.50
```

**Your Total:**
```
Stripe payment received: $96.80
Apify costs paid: -$7.50
NET PROFIT: $89.30 (89.3% net margin)
```

**Customer Total:**
```
Paid: $100
Used: $100 credits
Got: 50,000 followers
Cost per follower: $0.002 (vs X's $0.42/follower)
```
