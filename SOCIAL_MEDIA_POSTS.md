## Twitter Thread (Main Launch)

**Tweet 1:**
Built something I wish I had 2 years ago:

Export followers from ANY X account. Yours, competitors', anyone's.

Grok analyzes them instantly. CSV/JSON/Excel ready.

Under 500 followers? Free.

Thread on why this exists 👇

**Tweet 2:**
When I had 300 followers, I had no idea:
• Who they actually were
• Who followed my competitors
• Where to find my next customers
• How to track growth

Twitter shows you usernames. That's it.

**Tweet 3:**
The only options were:
• Manual scrolling (impossible at scale)
• Enterprise API ($42K/month 💀)
• Sketchy scrapers (get banned)
• Nothing

I chose nothing. It cost me months.

**Tweet 4:**
So I built Followlytics.

Export any public account's followers:
• Full profile data
• Grok analysis
• CSV/JSON/Excel
• 2-5 minutes

Your account. Their account. Anyone's.

**Tweet 5:**
Real use cases I'm seeing:

Sales teams → Export @competitor followers → 1000 leads
Recruiters → Export @YCombinator → 500 engineer profiles  
Indie hackers → Find customers hiding in competitor followers
VCs → Track portfolio growth monthly

**Tweet 6:**
Pricing is transparent:

<500 followers: FREE (I got you)
500-5K: $2.99
5K-25K: $4.99  
25K-100K: $9.99
100K-500K: $19.99
500K+: $49.99

+ Grok report FREE with all paid exports

**Tweet 7:**
Why so cheap?

Because I remember being at 300 followers and not being able to afford $99 tools.

My cost per export:
• APIs: $0.50-$3
• Grok: $0.75
• Infrastructure: $0.05

I make ~60-70% margin. Fair for both of us.

**Tweet 8:**
Coming soon: API access

Automate monthly exports, integrate into your CRM, build tools on top.

No subscriptions. Pay per export. Volume discounts.

Q1 2025. Want early access? Drop a 👀

**Tweet 9:**
The honest truth:

This isn't a growth hack. It's a research tool.

You're not paying for software. You're paying for compute (like Uber for data).

And if you're under 500 followers, you're not paying at all.

**Tweet 10:**
Try it:
→ followlytics.com

Export your followers. See who they are.
Or export your competitor's. See where your customers are hiding.

Just costs a little gas ⚡

## Reddit Post (r/SaaS, r/startups)

**Title:** Built a Grok-powered tool to export followers from any X account - honest breakdown of costs and why it exists

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I just launched Followlytics and wanted to share the story + be fully transparent about costs since I hate when founders aren't.

**What it does:**
Export followers from any public X account (yours, competitors', anyone's) + get Grok analysis. CSV/JSON/Excel ready in 2-5 minutes.

**Why I built it:**
When I was at 300 followers, I had zero visibility into my audience. Couldn't afford enterprise tools ($42K/month for Twitter API). So I built what I wish I had.

**Real costs (being transparent):**
- Small account (1K followers): My cost $0.20, you pay $2.99
- Medium (10K): My cost $0.50, you pay $4.99  
- Large (100K): My cost $3.00, you pay $9.99
- Massive (1M+): My cost $15.00, you pay $49.99

+ $0.75 per Grok analysis (included free)

**Why not charge more?**
Could easily charge $99+ and businesses would pay. But I remember being the broke founder who couldn't afford tools. So:
- Under 500 followers: FREE
- 500-25K: $2.99-$4.99 (individuals)
- 25K+: $9.99-$49.99 (businesses)

**Use cases people are finding:**
- Sales teams: Export competitor followers for lead gen
- Recruiters: Export @YC followers to source engineers
- Indie hackers: Find customers in competitor audiences
- VCs: Track portfolio company growth

**Coming soon:**
API access for automation. Pay per export, no subscriptions.

Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack, costs, or why I'm probably leaving money on the table 😅

## LinkedIn Post (Professional Audience)

**Headline:**
Launched a competitive intelligence tool I wish I had 2 years ago

**Body:**

After spending months manually researching competitors' audiences on X/Twitter, I built Followlytics.

**The problem:**
- Can't export follower data at scale
- Enterprise APIs cost $42K/month
- No way to analyze competitor audiences
- Flying blind on growth strategy

**The solution:**
Export followers from any public X account + get Grok analysis in minutes.

**Real business use cases:**

📊 **Sales Intelligence**
Export competitor followers → Filter by job title → Qualified lead list ready

🎯 **Talent Acquisition**  
Export industry leader followers → Find candidates with specific skills → Direct outreach

📈 **Market Research**
Analyze competitor audiences → Find gaps → Position strategically

💡 **Customer Development**
See who follows successful products in your space → Find early adopters

**Transparent pricing:**
Under 500 followers: Free
500-25K: $2.99-$4.99
25K+: $9.99-$49.99

(Our costs: $0.20-$15 per export + $0.75 for AI. We make ~60-70% margin.)

**Why I'm sharing costs:**
Too many B2B SaaS tools hide pricing and gouge customers. 

The data should be accessible. The pricing should be fair. The value should be obvious.

Built the tool I wish existed when I was grinding at 300 followers.

P.S. API launching Q1 2025 for automation and integration.

## Key Talking Points for Podcasts/Interviews

**Origin Story:**
"I was at 300 followers with zero visibility. Couldn't afford $42K/month enterprise tools. Built Followlytics as the tool I wish existed."

**The Insight:**
"Most people think of follower data as vanity metrics. But it's actually competitive intelligence - who follows your competitors, where are your customers hiding, how fast are you actually growing."

**The Positioning Shift:**
"We're not a 'social media tool.' We're competitive intelligence for X. Sales teams use us like they use Apollo. Recruiters use us like they use LinkedIn Recruiter. But for Twitter/X."

**Transparent Pricing:**
"Our cost is $0.20-$15 per export depending on size, plus $0.75 for AI. We charge $2.99-$49.99. I could charge 10x more but I remember being broke. So we keep margins fair."

**The Free Tier:**
"Under 500 followers is completely free. No trial, no upsell, just free. If you're grinding from zero, this is on me."

**Coming Soon:**
"API launching Q1. Automate monthly exports, integrate into CRMs, build tools on top. Pay per export, no minimums."

**The Vision:**
"I want this to be the research tool everyone uses to understand X audiences. Like you'd Google something, you'd 'Followlytics' an account."

**Addressing a Market Gap**

"When I was building my first audience on X with just 300 followers, I had no visibility into who they were or where to find more like them," said [Your Name], founder of Followlytics.

- Grok analysis providing audience demographics and engagement insights
- Support for accounts from 500 to 1M+ followers

- Presentation-ready reports for stakeholders

**Diverse Use Cases**

Early adopters include:
- Sales teams using competitor follower data for lead generation
- Recruiters sourcing candidates from industry leader audiences
- Indie founders finding early customers in competitor followings
- VCs tracking portfolio company growth metrics

**Transparent, Accessible Pricing**

Unlike traditional B2B intelligence tools, Followlytics uses pay-per-export pricing:
- Accounts under 500 followers: Free
- 500-5,000 followers: $2.99
- 5,000-25,000 followers: $4.99
- 25,000+ followers: $9.99-$49.99

All pricing includes Grok analysis at no additional cost.
