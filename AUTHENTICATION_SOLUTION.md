# üîê X.com Authentication Solution

## The Problem
OAuth 1.0a tokens from Twitter API cannot be used to authenticate browser sessions on X.com. They are different authentication systems:
- **OAuth tokens** = API access
- **Session cookies** = Browser access

## The Solution
Users need to provide their X.com session cookies for browser authentication.

## How Users Can Get Their Session Cookies

### Step 1: Log into X.com
1. Go to https://x.com in your browser
2. Log in normally with your username/password

### Step 2: Get Session Cookies
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
3. Click on "Cookies" ‚Üí "https://x.com"
4. Copy these important cookies:
   - `auth_token`
   - `ct0` 
   - `twid`

### Step 3: Provide Cookies to Followlytics
We need to add a form where users can paste these cookies securely.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add cookie input form** to dashboard
2. **Store cookies securely** (encrypted in database)
3. **Inject cookies** into sandbox browser
4. **Navigate to followers page** with authenticated session
5. **Extract real followers** successfully

## Security Notes
- Cookies should be encrypted before storage
- Cookies should expire and be refreshed periodically
- Users should understand this gives us temporary access to their X.com session

## User Experience
1. User clicks "Scan Followers"
2. If no valid cookies, show "Authenticate with X.com" form
3. User provides cookies once
4. All future scans use stored cookies
5. Cookies auto-expire for security

This approach will finally give us real authenticated browser sessions to access the followers page.
