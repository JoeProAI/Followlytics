Quick win for you.

I built Followlytics – turns X analytics into growth insights (competitor tracking, AI recommendations, trend predictions).

• Free Pro for 3 months
• Unique code for your audience
• 30% recurring commission

Want your link? lmk
```

### Launch Email
```
Subject: Your early access + founder pricing

We built Followlytics to solve one problem: 
X gives you data, but not insights you can act on.

Followlytics shows you:
✓ Why competitors are growing faster
✓ Which content patterns drive engagement
✓ When your audience is most active

[Try it free - no card required]
[Or get lifetime access - $119 one-time]

Founder pricing ends in 72 hours.

### X Launch Thread
```
1/ We analyzed 1,000 X creator profiles to find what correlates with follower growth.

The results surprised us.

Here's what the top 10% do differently:

[Chart 1]

2/ Finding #1: Post frequency matters less than you think.

Top creators post 8-12x/week.
Average creators post 12-18x/week.

Quality > Quantity is real.

[Chart 2]

3/ Finding #2: Reply rate is THE hidden lever.

Top creators reply to 40%+ of their mentions.
Average creators reply to <10%.

Engagement begets engagement.
