## Why Followlytics?

### The Problem with Traditional Solutions

- **Enterprise APIs cost $42,000/month** - Prohibitively expensive for most users
- **Third-party tools require credentials** - Security and privacy risks
- **Scrapers violate ToS** - Risk account suspension
- **No transparency** - Black box solutions you can't audit

### Our Solution

Followlytics solves these problems with a revolutionary approach:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User-Controlled Authentication">
    Users sign into X in their own browser - we never see credentials
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sandboxed Automation">
    Browser automation runs in isolated Daytona sandboxes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Privacy-First Data Handling">
    No sensitive data stored - everything happens client-side
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transparent Operations">
    Open source code you can audit and modify
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Innovations

### üîê Authentication Transfer System
Revolutionary privacy-first authentication where users sign in on their own browser, then signal the automation sandbox to continue - **no credentials ever shared**.

### üîÑ Sandbox Auto-Recovery
Automatic detection and recovery from expired sandboxes, creating fresh environments seamlessly without user intervention.

### üìä Real-Time Progress Tracking
Live updates showing extraction progress, current follower count, and detailed status messages.

### üõ°Ô∏è Compliance-First Architecture
Every component designed with X's Terms of Service in mind, using only user-authorized actions.
