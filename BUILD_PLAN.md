## Phase 2: Intelligence Features (Week 1) 🧠
**Build features that provide REAL value**

### 2.1 Content Intelligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Analyze user's tweet history for patterns**

**What it does:**
- Fetches ALL user tweets (up to 3200)
- Analyzes with Python/scikit-learn in Daytona:
  - Best tweet length (engagement per length bucket)
  - Optimal posting times (UTC hours with highest engagement)
  - Top performing topics/keywords
  - Hashtag effectiveness
  - Content patterns that work

**API:** `/api/intelligence/content-analysis`
**Input:** `{ username: "elonmusk" }`
**Output:** Actionable recommendations

**Build Steps:**
1. Create Daytona sandbox with Python env
2. Fetch all tweets via pagination
3. Store temporarily in sandbox
4. Run analysis algorithms
5. Return insights JSON
6. Cleanup sandbox

**Value:** "Your 150-200 char tweets posted at 9am UTC get 5x more engagement"

---

### 2.2 Historical Tracking ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Track engagement over time (what X API doesn't give you)**

**What it does:**
- Daily cron job fetches user's recent tweets
- Stores in Firestore with timestamp
- Builds historical dataset over weeks/months
- Detects engagement trends, anomalies
- Alerts on significant changes

**API:** 
- `/api/intelligence/tracking/start` - Start tracking user
- `/api/intelligence/tracking/trends` - Get historical trends

**Build Steps:**
1. Firestore collection: `tweet_history`
2. Cloud Function (or Daytona cron) runs daily
3. Fetches last 100 tweets for tracked users
4. Updates metrics in database
5. Calculates trends (7-day, 30-day averages)
6. Detects anomalies (engagement >2x or <0.5x normal)

**Value:** "Your engagement dropped 40% this week compared to last month"

---

### 2.3 Competitor Monitor ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Continuous competitor intelligence**

**What it does:**
- User adds competitors to watchlist
- Daily tracking of their tweets + metrics
- Compare your performance vs theirs
- Alert on strategy changes
- Find what's working for them

**API:**
- `/api/intelligence/competitor/add` - Add to watchlist
- `/api/intelligence/competitor/report` - Get insights

**Build Steps:**
1. Firestore: `competitor_watchlist`, `competitor_tweets`
2. Daily fetch of competitor tweets
3. Track: posting frequency, engagement rates, topics
4. Compare metrics against user's performance
5. Detect significant changes (alert logic)

**Value:** "Competitor X increased posting 3x and engagement is up 150%"

---

## Phase 3: Real-Time Features (Week 2) ⚡
**Live monitoring and predictions**

### 3.1 Viral Content Discovery ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Find trending content in user's niche**

**What it does:**
- User defines niche keywords
- Continuous search for high-engagement content
- Analyzes patterns (why it's viral)
- Curates best content

**API:** `/api/intelligence/viral-discovery`

**Value:** "10 viral posts in AI this week + why they worked"

---

### 3.2 Brand Monitoring ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Never miss important mentions**

**What it does:**
- 24/7 mention monitoring
- Sentiment analysis on each mention
- Priority scoring (important vs spam)
- Real-time alerts
- Track sentiment trends

**API:** `/api/intelligence/mentions/monitor`

**Value:** "3 critical mentions need response - sentiment trending negative"

---

## Phase 4: ML Features (Week 3) 🤖
**Predictive intelligence**

### 4.1 Performance Predictor ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Predict how a tweet will perform before posting**

**What it does:**
- User submits draft tweet
- ML model trained on their historical data
- Predicts engagement
- Suggests improvements

**API:** `/api/intelligence/predict`
**Input:** `{ text: "draft tweet..." }`
**Output:** `{ predicted_likes: 250, predicted_retweets: 45, recommendations: [...] }`

**Build Steps:**
1. Train ML model on user's historical tweets
2. Features: length, time, hashtags, keywords, sentiment
3. Use scikit-learn or simple regression model
4. Return prediction + confidence score

**Value:** "This tweet will get ~200 likes. Add a question to boost to 350"

---

### 4.2 Hashtag Intelligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Which hashtags actually work**

**What it does:**
- Track hashtag performance over time
- Find trending hashtags in niche
- Measure engagement impact
- Recommend optimal hashtags

**API:** `/api/intelligence/hashtags`

**Value:** "#AI gets 3x more reach than #ArtificialIntelligence in your niche"

---

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TailwindCSS, black/white professional design
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes
- **Database:** Firestore (historical data, user preferences, tracking)
- **X API:** twitter-api-v2 npm package
- **Compute:** Daytona sandboxes for heavy processing
- **ML:** Python + scikit-learn in Daytona
- **Auth:** Firebase Auth

### Daytona Usage Patterns

**Pattern 1: One-time Analysis**
```
User triggers analysis
→ Create Daytona sandbox
→ Install Python deps
→ Run analysis script
→ Return results
→ Destroy sandbox
```

**Pattern 2: Continuous Monitoring**
```
User starts tracking
→ Create persistent Daytona sandbox
→ Install cron + PostgreSQL
→ Run daily fetch jobs
→ Store data in DB
→ Keep sandbox running
→ User queries for insights
```

X API doesn't provide history - we build it over time

### 3. ML Intelligence
Predictions and pattern recognition, not just raw data

### 4. Professional Design
Clean, data-focused interface. No AI bubbly nonsense.

### 5. Free to Start
Lower barrier, build user base, validate before monetizing
