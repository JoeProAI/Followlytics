# Critical Issues to Fix

## 1. ‚ùå Subscription Upgrade Fails

### Problem
Users can't upgrade because Stripe price IDs are not configured.

### Root Cause
```typescript
// In pricing page
priceId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER  // undefined
priceId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO      // undefined
priceId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE  // undefined
```

### Fix Required (URGENT)

**Step 1: Create Stripe Products** (Do this in Stripe Dashboard)
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Click "Add Product"

**Product 1: Followlytics Starter**
- Name: Followlytics Starter
- Price: $29/month
- Billing: Recurring monthly
- Copy the price ID (starts with `price_`)

**Product 2: Followlytics Pro**
- Name: Followlytics Pro
- Price: $79/month
- Billing: Recurring monthly
- Copy the price ID

**Product 3: Followlytics Enterprise**
- Name: Followlytics Enterprise
- Price: $199/month
- Billing: Recurring monthly
- Copy the price ID

**Step 2: Add to Vercel Environment Variables**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Followlytics ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add these 3 variables (use your actual Stripe price IDs):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER=price_1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_2XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE=price_3XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

3. Redeploy the application

**Step 3: Configure Stripe Webhook**
1. Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://followlytics-zeta.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
4. Copy signing secret
5. Add to Vercel: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx`

### Temporary Workaround (Add to Code)

I'll add better error handling so users see helpful messages instead of silent failures.

## 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Overview Showing "Recent Post" (Not Actually Broken)

### Investigation
The code **IS** correctly selecting the top performing post:
- Uses engagement score: `likes + (retweets √ó 2) + (replies √ó 1.5)`
- Filters posts with 3+ engagements
- Selects highest scoring post

### Why It LOOKS Wrong
If the user's most recent post is also their best performing post (common for active accounts), it will appear as both:
- Recent: Because it was posted recently
- Top Performing: Because it has the most engagement

This is **CORRECT BEHAVIOR**, not a bug.

### Verification Test
```typescript
// Check if top post is actually highest engagement
const posts = data.recent_tweets;
const topPost = data.top_performing_tweet;

// Calculate scores for all posts
posts.forEach(post => {
  const score = post.public_metrics.like_count + 
                (post.public_metrics.retweet_count * 2) + 
                (post.public_metrics.reply_count * 1.5);
  console.log(`Post: ${post.id}, Score: ${score}`);
});

// Top post should have highest score
```

### If You Still Want to Change It
We can add a filter to exclude posts from the last 24 hours:

```typescript
// Only consider posts older than 24 hours for "top performing"
const oldEnoughPosts = posts.filter(post => {
  const postTime = new Date(post.created_at);
  const hoursSincePost = (Date.now() - postTime.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  return hoursSincePost > 24;
});

const topPost = this.findTopPerformingPost(oldEnoughPosts);
```

But this is **NOT RECOMMENDED** because:
- Posts go viral in first 24 hours
- Excluding recent posts misses real top performers
- User expectations are "highest engagement" not "highest engagement that's old"

## 3. ‚úÖ Features Working But Need UI Improvements

### Hashtag Analysis
- ‚úÖ Working (requires Pro tier)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error messages
- ‚úÖ Velocity calculation added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs better loading state in UI

### Tweet Analysis
- ‚úÖ Working (requires Pro tier)
- ‚úÖ Payment gate added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs better error display in UI

### Block/Mute Detection
- ‚úÖ Block detection working (Pro tier)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked list needs Daytona implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Muted list needs Daytona implementation
- ‚ùå Mute detection by others is impossible (documented)

## Testing Checklist

### Test Subscription Flow
```bash
# 1. Navigate to /pricing (logged in)
# 2. Click "Start Free Trial" on Starter

## Error Messages Users Might See

### "Failed to start subscription"

**Fix**: Add price IDs to Vercel environment variables  
**User Action**: Contact support

### "Upgrade required"
**Cause**: Feature requires higher tier (working as intended)  
**Fix**: None needed - this is payment gating working  
**User Action**: Upgrade plan

### "X API rate limit exceeded"
**Cause**: Too many requests to X API  
**Fix**: Implement rate limiting + caching
