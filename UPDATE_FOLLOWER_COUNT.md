# Update @JoeProAI Follower Count

## Manual Update (Quick)

You can manually update the follower count anytime by calling the API:

```bash
# Update to current count (example: 850 followers)
curl -X POST https://followlytics.vercel.app/api/community/growth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "followerCount": 850,
    "adminKey": "YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_HERE"
  }'
```

## Set Admin Key

Add this to your Vercel environment variables:

```
COMMUNITY_UPDATE_KEY=some-secure-random-string-here
```

## Current Tiers

| @JoeProAI Followers | Export Limit | Tier Name |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 0 - 999 | 1,000 | Starter Community |
| 1,000 - 2,499 | 2,000 | Growing Community |
| 2,500 - 4,999 | 5,000 | Thriving Community |
| 5,000 - 9,999 | 10,000 | Established Community |
| 10,000+ | 20,000 | Massive Community |

## How It Works

1. **Cache System**: Follower count cached for 1 hour to avoid excessive checks
2. **Free Tier Only**: Paid users bypass this entirely (get their tier limits)
3. **Progressive Unlocks**: All free users benefit when community grows
4. **Auto-Updates**: Cache refreshes hourly, but you can manually update anytime

## Testing

```bash
# Check current community status
curl https://followlytics.vercel.app/api/community/growth

# Should return:
{
  "success": true,
  "joeproFollowers": 800,
  "currentTier": {
    "followers": 0,
    "limit": 1000,
    "label": "Starter Community"
  },
  "nextTier": {
    "followers": 1000,
    "limit": 2000,
    "label": "Growing Community"
  },
  "progress": 80,
  "message": "You're in the Starter Community! 200 more followers to unlock Growing Community."
}
```

## When You Hit Milestones

### At 1,000 followers:
```bash
curl -X POST https://followlytics.vercel.app/api/community/growth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "followerCount": 1000,
    "adminKey": "YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
  }'
```

**Result**: All free users can now export up to 2,000 followers! ðŸŽ‰

### At 2,500 followers:
Export limit increases to 5,000 for all free users.

### At 5,000 followers:
Export limit increases to 10,000 for all free users.

### At 10,000 followers:
Export limit increases to 20,000 for all free users.

## Future Automation

You could automate this with:
- **Cron job**: Check @JoeProAI follower count daily
- **Webhook**: Twitter API sends updates
- **Manual**: Update when you notice milestone reached

## Example: Automatic Daily Update

```typescript
// api/cron/update-community/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  // Fetch @JoeProAI follower count from Apify or Twitter
  const followerCount = await fetchJoeProAIFollowers()
  
  // Update cache
  await updateCommunityCache(followerCount)
  
  return Response.json({ success: true, followerCount })
}
```

Schedule in Vercel Cron:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/update-community",
    "schedule": "0 0 * * *"  // Daily at midnight
  }]
}
```

## Default Fallback

If the API fails or cache is empty, the system defaults to **800 followers** (your current count), which gives users the **1,000 export limit** (Starter Community tier).

## User Experience

Free users see this banner in their dashboard:

```
ðŸŒ± Community Growth Unlocks

As @JoeProAI grows, your export limits grow too! We're building this together.

Current Export Limit: 1,000
Your Current Tier: Starter Community

[Progress Bar: 80% (800/1,000 followers)]
200 more followers to unlock Growing Community (2,000 exports)!

[Follow @JoeProAI] [Or Upgrade for Unlimited] [Dismiss]
```

## Notes

- **Paid users never see this** - they get their tier limits regardless
- **Banner is dismissible** - stored in localStorage
- **Non-intrusive** - clear value proposition, not a paywall
- **Community-focused** - "we grow together" messaging
- **Multiple paths** - follow, share, refer, OR upgrade

Enjoy your viral growth system! ðŸš€
